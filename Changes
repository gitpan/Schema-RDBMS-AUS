Revision history for Perl extension Schema::RDBMS::AUS.

0.03  ?
    - Switched to using YAML instead of JSON, since YAML can store
      reference types natively and there *is* a YAML parser available
      for JavaScript.
    - Fleshed out the documentation for CGI::Session::AUS. Thanks to
      Mark Stosberg for pointing this out. :-)
